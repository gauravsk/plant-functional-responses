## Motivating questions 

Plant performance often varies over space, but species often vary in how they respond to the same underlying variation. In this project I aim to describe *which* environmental layers plant performance (as meaured by the seed production of 17 annual plant species in the absence of competitors) responds to across Sedgwick reserve. This analysis will be done across the whole dataset ("Which environmental layers are annual plants responding to at Sedgwick?"). 

The second question will be based on the observation in nature (and in our dataset) that plant species don't all have the same response to environmental variation-- for example, some species achieve their maximal performance in different places. To explore this further, I will ask whether there is significant species variation in their response to the same environmental conditions (their "functional response"), and which environmental layers these species are segregating on. 

The third question will explore whether species functional traits help explain variation in species' functional response to the environment.
